# IPL Win Probability Prediction 🏏

Predict the **win probability of the second batting team** in an Indian Premier League (IPL) match using machine learning! This project leverages historical IPL match data to provide real-time insights and predictions for match outcomes.

---

## 🔹 Project Overview

In this project, I developed an **end-to-end machine learning pipeline** to predict the likelihood of the second batting team winning a match. The model uses **logistic regression** and includes:

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning raw IPL data, handling missing values, and preparing datasets for analysis.
- **Feature Engineering:** Extracting meaningful features such as current score, wickets left, overs remaining, and more.
- **Model Training & Evaluation:** Building a logistic regression model and evaluating its predictive performance.
- **Prediction & Insights:** Outputting win probabilities that can inform real-time match strategies.

## 🔹 Key Features

- Accurate win probability predictions for the chasing team.
- Intuitive feature engineering capturing match dynamics.
- Scalable pipeline for future IPL seasons.
- Visualizations for better understanding of match progression.
